      	<p>
      	  On freenode there have been reports of bots joining channels, idling in them, and then quitting. 
      	    It is unknown for what reason they do this, but they can be a nuiscance and should be banned.
      	    However, they constantly change IPs so this project was created to find the IPs.
      	</p>
      	<h2 id="features" class="content-subhead">Identifying features.<a href="premise" class="content-link"></a></h2>
      	    These are some identifying features of the bots.
      	  <ul>
      	  	<li><strong>Hostmask</strong> &mdash; These bots will have a cloak with their IP as the cloak.
      	  	  The ident will have a leading ~ and will follow with the first 9 letters of the nick. 
      	  	  Additionally, the nick will be enitrely lower case with no numbers or any character 
      	  	  besides the alphabet. </br> <em>Example: examplenick!~exmpleni@127.0.0.1</em></li>
      	  	 <li><strong>Quitting message</strong> &mdash; The bots will always quit after a short
      	  	  period with the message "Remote host has closed the connection."</li>
      	  	 <li><strong>CTCP</strong> &mdash; The bots will not reply to any form of CTCP, 
      	  	  including <code>CTCP PING.</code> Do <strong>NOT</strong> CTCP them under any 
      	  	  circumstances, even if you suspect that they may be a bot. </li>
      	  	 <li><strong>IP Range</strong> &mdash; THe bots have been comming from certain CIDR 
      	  	 Ranges, see the next section for more information. Once the ranges are determined then
      	  	 you can ban those ranges. </li>
        <h2 id="ranges" class="content-subhead">Ranges<a href="#ranges" class="content-link"></a></h2>
        <p>
          The following IP ranges are known to have been K-lined by freenode staff. However, we have no
          way of knowing if they still are. Moreover, this list may be incomplete.
